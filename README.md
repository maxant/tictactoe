Here, I want to add some more clever stuff.

1) add determining how quickly the algo "learns". it must have learned all the basic
   immediate wins and losses. how to counter openings to centre, edge and corners. best starting location.
   this way we can compare different algos. forks after starting.

2) add thinking ahead when it doesnt know the pattern (very well)

3) move on to chess :-)
